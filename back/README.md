# README

This is the api of the application.

For the sake fo simplicity it relies on an in-memory sqllite database.

Although it was built in RoR it's outside of the scope of this application to leverage advanced
Ruby knowledge.

# Setup

After the cloning the repository, the following steps are required to bootstrap the backend

* Install ruby (tested on 2.3.5+)
* cmd: `gem install bundle`
* cmd: `bundle install`
* cmd: `rake db:setup`
  * 2 files should be generated development.sqlite3 and test.sqllite3
* to start the server run `rails s`

Any editor/ide is welcome, but a few steps in order to use vscode as a debugger:

* Install the following extensions `Ruby`, `SolarGraph`
* gem install solargraph

Optionally byebug can be used to debug at the rails console


# Models

There are 3 straight-forward models describing an ultra simplified version of QueroBolsa's search engine:

* Offer (belongs_to 1 university and 1 course)
* University (has many courses)
* Course (has many universities)

# API

The following endpoints are available:

* `/api/offer` --> list of offers, where several query parameters can be included:
  * university_id the id of the university to filter
  * course_id the id of the course to filter
  * kind either `Presencial`, `EAD`
  * level `Graduação`, `Pos-Graduação`
  * shift either `Manha`, `Tarde`, `Noite`
  * discount_percentage_min the min discount the user is seeking
  * offered_price_max the max price the user is seeking
  * page the page number you want to get
* `/api/offer/{offer_id}` --> loads a specific offer for details
* `/api/course/`--> list of all available courses. Accepts name as a query parameter
* `/api/university/`--> list of all available universities. Accepts name as a query parameter
* `/api/university/{university_id}`--> details of a given university
* `/api/university/{university_id}/offer`--> offers of a given university
* `/api/university/{university_id}/course`--> courses of a given university
